presentation:

1)
	TALK ABOUT THE IDEA OF THE PROJECT.
		A) WHY YOU CHOSE TO CREATE A PHOTO IMAGE PROJECT. 
			- PERSONAL INTEREST IN PHOTOS
			- EASY TO FIND CONTENT TO USE FOR THE PROJECT
			- GOOD PROJECT TO SHOW DATABASE INTERACTION
2)
	TALK ABOUT THE TRELLO BOARD AND WHAT PROCESS WAS FOLLOWED TO PLAN WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO.
		A) SHOW TRELLO BOARD, WIRE FRAMES, USER STORIES, SITE MAPS...
			- FREE APPLICATION
			- EASY TO USE 
			- PRESENTS VERY WELL
3)
	TALK ABOUT THE SYSTEMS I'VE CHOSEN TO USE IN THE APPLICATION AND WHY:
		1) SPRINGBOOT 
			A) I ADAPTED SPRING BOOT FROM WORK THAT JOHN HAD SENT TO US. I KEPT IT DUE TO HOW SIMPLE IT IS TO SET UP AND USE WITH VARIOUS 
			   DATABASES.
				- IT REDUCES A LOT OF DEVELOPMENT TIME AND INCREASES PRODUCTIVITIY.
				- IT'S EASY TO IMPLEMENT INTO JAVA BACKEND CODE. 
				- IT PROVIDES A LOT OF PRE-BUILT PLUGINS.
		2) MYSQL
			A) I DECIDED TO USE SQL/MYSQL AS IT'S A DATABASE THAT I'M MORE FAMILIAR WITH COMPARED TO H2 WHICH WAS USED IN THE TODO PROJECT.
				- GLOBALLY KNOWN FOR BEING SECURE
				- UNMATCHED SCALABILITY TO FACILITATE MANAGEMENT NEEDS. 
				- HIGH PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK AND FACIILITIES. 
		3) JAVASCRIPT
			A) I DECIDED TO USE VANILLA JAVASCRIPT AS IT'S ABLE TO PERFORM THE TASKS I REQUIRE AND IT'S A VERSION OF JS THAT I'M
			   MOST USED TO.
				- VOID OF 3RD PARTY ADD-ONS. 
				- SELF-RELIANT
				- FULLY CUSTOMISABLE.
				- FREE TO USE.
		4) HTML
			A) I DECIDED TO LAYOUT MY HMTL PAGES WITH A SET DESIGN FOR EACH PAGE (E.G. NAVBAR) SO THAT IT LOOKS SMART AND MAINTAINS THE SAME 
			   DESIGN LANGUAGE THROUGHOUT THE APPLICATION.
				- EASY TO USE AND UNDERSTAND
				- ALL BROWSERS SUPPORT HTML
				- HTML IS FREE
		5) CSS
			A) LINKED TO BOOTSTRAP
				- VERY CONSISTENT 
				- EASY TO MAINTAIN AND UPDATE
				- LIGHTWEIGHT CODE
		7) BOOTSTRAP
			A) I DECIDED TO USE BOOTSTRAP AS IT HAS ALL THE FEATURES THAT CAN MAKE A CLEAN DESIGNED WEB APPLICATION WITH LITTLE EFFORT.
			   THIS HAS SAVED LOTS OF TIME. 
				- EASY TO USE
				- SPEED OF DEVELOPMENT
				- VERY CUSTOMISABLE. 

		8) XMLHTTPREQUEST
			A) I DECIDED TO USE XMLHTTPREQUEST AS IT'S SIMPLE, EASY TO USE AND A REQUEST TYPE THAT I'M MOST FAMILIAR WITH. 
				- ASYNCHRONOUS
				- SIMPLE TO USE
				- SPEED
4)
	TALK ABOUT WHAT HAS GONE WELL.
		A) I'M VERY HAPPY WITH MY FRONTEND AS I BELIEVE IT LOOKS VERY CLEAN AND SIMPLISTIC WHILE SHOWING ALL THE FEATURES I'D LIKE.
		   I'M HAPPY WITH HOW THE FRONTEND CAN LINK WITH THE BACKEND QUITE EASILY. 
		   I'M HAPPY WITH HOW THE BACKEND CAN EASILY CONNECT TO THE MYSQL DATABASE AND INPUT INTO THE FIELDS THROUGH THE FRONT END.
5)
	TALK ABOUT WHAT HASN'T GONE SO WELL.
		A) I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO COMPLETE THE SEARCH TOOL AND RATINGS TOOL AND SHARING OPTIONS.
		   WHILE MY UPLOAD FORM DOES ADD TO THE DATABASE, THE FILE UPLOAD TOOL WORKS BY ADDING A FILE PATH TO THE DB
		   SO EFFECTIVELY, IT WILL ONLY WORK IF YOU UPLOAD FROM A CERTAIN FOLDER ON MY PC. HOWEVER, THIS COULD EASILY 
		   BE ADAPTED TO WORK WITH A SERVER THAT WOULD STORE A COPY OF THE UPLOADED IMAGE AS IT WOULD STILL USE THE FILE
		   PATH AND NOT THE IMAGE FILE DIRECTLY. 

		   I'VE ALSO NOT GOT A FEATURE TO EDIT THE UPLOADS WHICH WOULD BE A USEFUL TOOL TO USE BUT WASN'T PART OF MY ORIGNAL TRELLO BOARD 
		   USER STORIES. 
6) 
	TALK ABOUT WHAT I'D DO NEXT TIME.
		A) NOW THAT I'M MORE EXPERIENCED IN WHAT I'VE CREATED I'D MANAGE MY TIME MORE EFFECTIVELY SO THAT I CAN 
		   IMPLEMENT MORE FEATURES LIKE THE SHARING OR RATINGS TOOL.
		   I WOULD'VE LIKED TO HAVE DELVED DEEPER INTO THE FILE UPLOAD FORM AS I BELIEVE I COULD'VE MADE IT WORK LIKE
		   A FILE UPLOAD TOOL SHOULD DO (SEE ABOVE). 

		   ADDING TO THE ABOVE, THE EDIT FEATURE WOULD DEFINITELY BE A GOOD FEATURE TO ADD/AIM FOR FROM THE START IF I HAD THE CHANCE TO 
		   WORK ON THIS PROJECT AGAIN. 
7) 
	SUMMARISE.
		A) OVERALL, I BELIEVE THAT MY PROJECT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN MOST ASPECTS. I'M ABLE TO UPLOAD, RETRIEVE AND DELETE FROM A DATABASE.
		   THE VARIOUS PAGES ALL FOLLOW A SET DESIGN LANGUAGE AND THANKS TO BOOTSTRAP THEY LOOK PROFESSIONAL. I'VE BEEN ABLE TO USE DIFFERENT
		   FEATURES FROM BOOTSTRAP, SUCH AS THE PHOTO REEL TO SHOW DIFFERENT MAIN PHOTOS ON THE HOMEPAGE. 

		   UNFORTUNATELY, THERE WERE SOME FEATURES THAT I WASN'T ABLE TO IMPLEMENT IN THE TIME GIVEN BUT IF I WERE TO COMPLETE THIS PROJECT AGAIN
		   I BELIEVE THAT I'D BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THE FEATURES.
